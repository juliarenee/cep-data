# CEP and Title I analysis
WRAL News analyzed the impact of adopting the Community Eligibility Provision, a federal program that provides public schools with universal free lunch, on Title I funding. Our analysis found that participating in CEP might address food insecurity, but it could cost schools tens of thousands of dollars in federal aid towards school supplies, improving curricula and hiring extra staff.

The Community Eligibility Provision can be a blessing for low-income public schools. The program was nationally launched in 2014 with a simple goal: Universal free lunch, no questions asked.

Participating in CEP increases the number of children eating, boosts student achievement and reduces suspension rates. Adopting CEP also means that families no longer need to file for free and reduced price lunch, which can be a tedious process. And despite previously having been among those with the most unpaid meals, all 13 Durham public schools that now participate in the CEP program have zero debt.

But last year, Durham Public Schools still racked up over $209,000 in school lunch debt, or roughly 72,000 meals. It's the most the district has seen in the past eight years. And when families can't or won't pay their tab, the school district foots the bill-taking away from funds that could go towards school supplies or additional programming.

That debt is concentrated among a small group of low-income schools, where a majority of students are Black or Hispanic: just 23 percent of schools accounted for 40 percent of all unpaid meals.

All those schools were all eligible to participate in the Community Eligibility Provision.

Last year, only 12 of the 25 schools eligible for CEP participated the program. If they had adopted the provision, school lunch debt could have dropped by up to $80,000.

This poses a question: With such a seemingly perfect solution to addressing food insecurity and mitigating debt, why aren't these schools participating?

A WRAL analysis found that one unitented consequence of adopting CEP is the risk of losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in Title I funding, putting two federal programs at odds.
